On the R console, the ">" character is your prompt -- meaning that R is ready for you to enter a command. If R is looking for more input on your curreent command, the prompt changes to "+".

Absolute paths -- start with "/" on Unix, Linux, and Mac or "C:\" (or some other drive letter) on Windows.
Relative paths don't start with a leading slash or drive letter.

**Assignment operators**
Use "<-" to assign a value to  a variable (e.g. "x <- 5" to set the variable   x to the value 5). This is the standard asssignnment operator in R. The equals sign "=" is also an assignment operator but it is primariily used in function arguments. (The two assignment operattors work the same most of the time but not in all cases. The arrow assignment operator "<-" is generally preferred.)

Short cuts:

   * 'Alt -'   (for <-)
   * Up arrow/down arrow to go through previous commands
   * 'Crtl Shift C' will allow you to make several highlighted lines as comments
   * 
= gives you a local assignment
<- gives you a global assignment

You can talk to either Gautham or Evan if you have any questions!!

Use '#' for comments (the computer will ignore anything behind #)
Comments will allow you to remember why you did something (Good idea to comment frequently!)
Comments will also help when you share with others

== **tests **whether things are equal
